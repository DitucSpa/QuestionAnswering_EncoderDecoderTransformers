# QuestionAnswering_EncoderDecoderTransformers
 
Question answering (QA) aims at providing correct answers to questions based on some given context or knowledge; in the last few years, this task has seen considerable growth thanks to the advent of transformers. In this project, we performed a Question&Answering task by using two fine-tuned transformer models
(BERT-tiny and DistiBERT) with an encoder-decoder configuration.
